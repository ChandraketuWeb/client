We first like to take a step back and complete an initial audit of your existing online presence, your business as a whole, your competitors and your target audience.

                                                                                                              We don’t create content for our clients without first doing our due diligence in research. We learn everything we can about your business, your competitors and your target market.

                                                                                                              Even though we are well-versed in executing digital marketing services for industries of all kinds, we still take the time to understand your specific business.

                                                                                                              These are the types of questions we really dig in to answer with you.

                                                                                                              We’ll help you develop a marketing plan and find the right audience. Outside of the basics such as their age, location etc., what really drives your target audience to take action?

                                                                                                              What goals motivate them and what pain points are they trying to solve? What do their behavior patterns look like online?

                                                                                                              After we’ve completed some extensive research and crafted a strategy that’s specific to your business, we’ll then go on to create content for your social media platforms.

                                                                                                              The amount of content we create depends on the plan you’ve signed up for, but in general we create copy and an image (or video) to accompany that copy for every post.

                                                                                                              The call to actions we include in the copy will vary depending on which social media platforms you’re publishing on. For example, Instagram does not allow links in the copy, so we usually refer to the link in the bio. Twitter has a stricter character limit than other platforms, so we adjust your copy there accordingly.

                                          </p>

                                                                                                              As far as the imagery that publishes with the copy, we can use graphics, GIFs and videos alike.

                                                                                                              The main point here is that we create content that specifically based on the data we find in researching your business.

                                                                                                              We use that knowledge to create copy and graphics that will attract the attention of your target audience and stand out from the competition.

                                                                                                              3-engagement-phones

                                                                                                              We understand that! That’s why we take publishing off your hands too.

                                                                                                              We create content calendars for our clients a month in advance, and then we use our publishing and analytics software to schedule out the entire month’s worth of content in one sitting.

                                                                                                              This allows us to ensure no errors are made in the posts, it saves you (and us!) time, allowing us to focus on other aspects of your marketing, and it allows your social media followers to expect regular posts from you.

Behind every tweet and post, there is an advertising platform that allows you to put money behind your content.

                                                                                                              You can either “boost” your existing social media posts, or you can create completely new social media ads to run.

                                                                                                              Either way, social media advertising essentially allows you to put your content, brand and website in front of more people within your target audience, faster.

                                         <p>                                                                     Depending on what your business goals and social media goals are, there are several different types of ad campaigns we can suggest. They vary by objective. Whether you need to drive traffic to your website, drive direct sales on your website, drive lead conversions on your website, or simply increase your social media followers and engagement, social media advertising can help you achieve it all.

                                                                                                              Our social media ad specialists are experienced and capable of executing any ad campaign you need or that we deem best fit for your business.

                                                                                                              That’s because the online landscape changes every minute of every day, and that includes social media!

The reason we help so many businesses with their social media marketing is because social media provides them the avenue to do just this.

Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram for example offer a world of targeting options. You can target Facebook users by demographics, interests and behaviors and you can also upload your own list of customers or email subscribers to either retarget them or find new customers that look like them in a lookalike audience.</p>

Smaller agencies often bite off more than they can chew, stretch themselves thin trying to serve as many clients as they can and provide you with mediocre service as a result. You may run into unreasonably long turnaround times, or receive poorly-executed work in this case. Oppositely, to bigger, corporate marketing chains you run the risk of being another client to them: another number to perform the same cardboard marketing efforts for.

If so, how have you handled them so far? Sometimes, small business owners make the mistake of placing lesser importance on their online reviews because they don’t think their business is “big enough” yet for them to matter much. But that couldn’t be further from the truth! Listen to this: 91% of 18-34 year olds trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. Plus, 93% of consumers say that online reviews influenced their purchasing decisions. Lastly, 89% of marketers are showing that influencer marketing (a concept where social media users are influenced by social media figures with high followers) is providing a higher ROI than most other channels. So clearly, your reputation, what people say about you online and online reviews all matter a lot because the data that’s out there today shows us that your online reviews have a direct impact on your sales! This is why when you’re a client of COOPERATEUP, we take special care to monitor and respond to all of your online reviews, good or bad. Our experts are trained in damage control should you ever receive severely negative reviews, and oppositely we know how to foster positive reviews as well.

                                                                      <p>
                                                                                You probably hear the term “brand awareness” a good bit. A lot of marketers talk about how increased brand awareness is a positive thing and you need more of it… but what is it really? What does increasing your brand awareness really look like and how does it impact your business? Oxford Languages describes brand awareness as, “the extent to which consumers are familiar with the distinctive qualities or image of a particular brand of goods or services.” In other words, people can’t buy from you if they don’t know you exist. And to take it a step further, people won’t buy from you if they know who you are but don’t trust you. While a big part of digital marketing is all about metrics and data and about measuring website clicks and conversion rates, something that’s equally important but sometimes harder to track is how people feel about your business. Once people become familiar with your business, do they associate your brand with positive or negative thoughts in their brain? Was the experience that led to them learning of your brand in the first place a good one or a bad one? Brand awareness should exist at the top of your marketing funnel to ensure two things: 1) that you acquire consistent, qualified new leads and followers and 2) that they enter your funnel with a positive outlook on your brand. This is one aspect of digital marketing that COOPERATEUP puts a special focus on.

Whether you’re using social ads or Google ads, getting your advertisements launched is only half the battle (and even that can take a lot of technical know how!). Beyond setting your ads up within the native advertising platform, you also have to install a conversion tracking pixel on your website from every ad platform you intend to use. The conversion pixel is what allows you to see how many sales or lead form completions have happened on your website as a direct result of your social or Google ads. The instructions for installing it vary by ad platform as well as by the type of website you have. This is where having a digital marketing expert at your side takes the headache out of the process! We do this countless times a day and can breeze right through this process for you- but like we mentioned above, that’s only half the battle! After your ads are set up correctly and launched, what happens if you still fail to generate sales from them? This is where conversion optimization comes in. Our team is skilled in analyzing your campaign for areas of opportunity and looking at the data of any results received so far (including impressions, clicks, engagement etc.) to make informed decisions with your campaign moving forward. If your campaign is not receiving strong results, there are often things that can be changed and optimized to get the ball rolling. Other agencies may “set it and forget it” as we say, but not COOPERATEUP!

Make sure you have a presence online to meet them in their search! We mentioned above that our search engine marketing services help you appear first in the search results on search engines like Google. Well, social media platforms like Instagram are starting to have their own SEO processes as well! For example, you can now optimize your Instagram account so that it appears for search terms that are relevant to your business (and we’re not just talking about hashtags or location tags, we’re talking about regular search queries in the search bar!). Additionally, if someone does click to your website from a search query on Google or Instagram or anywhere else, social media can be used to retarget that traffic and get them back to your website again and again until they convert. Overall, our social media management service will help your business to utilize social media effectively and generate new leads and sales..
